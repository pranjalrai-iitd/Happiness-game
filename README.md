# Happiness Game

Happiness game is an assignment submission for my Positive Psychology course, at IIT Delhi. The assignment was to represent the Happiness related character strengths in an innovative and engaging pictorial way.

## Background

### "Avoiding traits which are not in favour of happiness is the easiest way to be happy!"

Some traits which I think are in favour of Happiness are:
- Peace
- Perseverance
- Success
- Punctuality
- Humour

Some traits which I think are not in favour of happiness are:
- Violence
- Loss
- Procrastination
- Injury
- Disappointment

### Description

In the game the user controls a character named **“Happy”**. As the game proceeds many hurdles tagged with various unhappy traits rushes towards Happy. Happy can jump using the “Up” key. The player has the responsibility to press the **Up** key and help Happy to jump over the hurdles.
Longer the Happy survives the higher user scores.
Higher the score, more hurdles jumped over and, more the hurdles of unhappiness jumped, more motivated and happier the user should be.
